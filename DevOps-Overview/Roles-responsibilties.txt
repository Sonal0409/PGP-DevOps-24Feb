Service Ownership –
A devOps engineer can be part of the DevOps/SRE team, whose mission is the shared full stack ownership of a collection of services and/or technology areas. 
As a devops team member you will have to understand the end-to-end product, configuration, technical dependencies, and overall behavioral characteristics of the production services, monitoring, diagnosability, incident management, etc.
A devOps engineer works closely with development teams and will have the responsibility to ensure that services are designed and delivered to be mission critical with focus on security, resiliency, scale, and performance.

Service Design – you will partner with development teams in defining and implementing improvements in service architecture, both current and future. You will be an expert at articulating technical characteristics of your services and the dependencies between services and guide Development teams to engineer and add premier capabilities to the Oracle Cloud service portfolio. Additionally, contribute to implementation of service functionality to solve customer requirements.

Service Monitoring - Define Service Level Objectives (SLO) and implement/monitor Service Level Indicators (SLI) for production services. Aggregate data from multiple monitoring tools, normalize, and build tools and alerts for the overall system health.


Operations Engineering – You will understand and be able to communicate the scale, capacity, security, performance attributes and requirements of the services you own. You are a Subject Matter Expert, able to understand and communicate every characteristic of your service stack, such as: degradation and behavior under load of the services and their dependencies end-to-end tuning needs, optimizing resource utilization, as load patterns fluctuate Instrumentation and metrics that clearly describe the service behaviors scaling requirements and patterns, resiliency and recoverability, ensuring that backup / restore and disaster recovery capabilities are implemented, tested and maintained


Service Automation – You will have a clear understanding of automation and orchestration principles, and will be eager to automate, wherever and whenever the possibility arises, while simultaneously eliminating technical debt. Automation must be part of your DNA.


Prevention - Once you have expertly resolved an issue, you will immediately work on how to more quickly resolve the problem next time, with the goal to eventually prevent the problem happening ever again


Broad Interests - DevOps engineers are a rare mix of sysadmins and development engineers, and as such have the ability to understand and explain the effect of product architecture decisions on the ability to run as distributed systems. They are driven by professional curiosity and a desire to develop deep understanding of their services and the technologies they depend upon.

Represent DevOps - Proactive, self-motivated, customer-focused, organized, and a good communicator. DevOps Engineers can be expected to represent Cloud products and engineering in sensitive forums.
